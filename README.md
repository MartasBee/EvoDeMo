This thesis deals with the utilization of evolutionary techniques to find such environment
characteristics, that allow the object in this environment to perform the movement according
to specified parameters. The environment which is utilized in this work is a cellular
automaton, whose local transition function is optimized using the genetic algorithm. The
principles of computational development are applied. The presented work tends to the area
of theoretical biology. Its main objective is to create a simple simulator of life of artificial
organisms. In particular, movement as a specific aspect of life is considered. For this purpose
the application allows the designer to define an organism at the level of cells of the cellular
automaton and apply the genetic algorithm to design the transition function specifying the
behavior of the organism according to given parameters.
